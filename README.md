# CustomClean 1.1
> For HCP outputs and other things you need to clean up!

## Usage
1. CustomClean GUI (custom_clean_gui.py)
> Choose an example directory and click files to delete within it,
> then save a JSON of that pattern that can be run on any directory with a
> similar file structure.

  * Select an example directory (e.g. a subject directory) and click `Open`.
  * In new file tree window, choose folders or files to **delete**, then click `OK`.
    * *Please note: If working with a subject folder that contains multiple
    REST directories, any changes made to REST1 will be applied to all other
    REST directories. Changes made to any REST directories other than REST1 will be ignored.*
  * Choose a directory and filename for your JSON file and click `Save`.
  * The GUI will notify you whether your JSON was created successfully.

2. CustomClean Cleaning Script (cleaning_script.py)
> Run the pattern generated by the GUI and saved in a JSON on a directory.

  * Takes two arguments: -j --json [path to JSON] -d --dir [path to target directory]
  * Error information will display on the console.
  * Success information (i.e. what files, directories, and links were removed)
  will be written to a file at the top level of the target directory called
  `custom_clean_success_record.txt`.

  * NOTE: * may now be used as a wildcard in filenames when running the cleaning script on
  target directories, e.g. for subject IDs in filenames. As of this writing, it involves
  manually editing the JSON before running the cleaning script.
